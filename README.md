Xcoin White Paper
-----------------

June 18, 2020 - Mexico

Xcoin is an experiment in private collectible crypto currency, and personal monetization. To begin, I pay homage to Satoshi Nakamoto - and the original White Paper. I stand by the principles of blockchain decentralization, immutability of the basic blockchain parameters (no forks) - and the notion that we are mere guardians of the math that make crypto currency function. What I hope to show with Xcoin is yet another way in which the democratization of money brought about by the RPC protocol has opened up new possibilities, and that RPC blockchain technology is flexible enough to be able to successfully create many different kinds of money in the same eco-system.

Xcoin was not designed to be best at value transmission such as making online payments, etc. It is a slow and solid chain set up to be a store of monetary and cultural value over time, with trading between a few individuals and a support fan-base (The X followers). Therefore speed was not essential in the creation of this blockchain. The block reward begins at 5 XCN with difficulty targeting a block-time of 20 minutes average. The reward halvings will come every 20,000 blocks.

Xcoin has a high scarcity factor, with only 200,000 Xcoins being mined over 22 years - which is the anticipated life-span of the blockchain (and the X, probably). Severe deflation will be avoided by the fact that Xcoin has an anticipated small and parochial user base, and there is only likely to be one merchant accepting Xcoin (me, for my books and writings). Xcoin value store will be very steady over time.

Xcoin is also not designed to be particularly easy to mine. The small nature of the user-base, combined with the extremely high par value of Xcoin - makes ease of mining a secondary concern. Xcoin is a fork of BitCoin 1.7 that uses the standard SHA-256 PoW hashing algorithm. Blocks can take up to an hour to be resolved, and this again is by design - it is supposed to be a slow and steady chain. Xcoin would not be an ideal crypto currency for public payment systems. Likewise, and for these same reasons, Xcoin would not be a good choice for blockchain etching or layering - or any other form of RPC data storage and retrieval. XCN is a simple currency.

Xcoin is an exploration into the possibilities presented by the RPC blockchain technology in the area of private and collectible crypto currency, and personal monetization. One of the original founders of the BitCoin Foundation once said that far from being against Alt Coins, he embraces them, and envisions a day when every group, and every person even - will literally have their own money. Xcoin is not innovative, nor the first of its kind. The first of this sort of crypto currency that I am aware of is MaxCoin created and launched by television personality Max Kaiser. He launched the chain live on his very popular tv show, and it was a very interesting experiment.
